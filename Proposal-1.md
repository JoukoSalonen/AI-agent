##AI Review

### Summary: 

The proposal suggests the creation of a tokenomics system for UpstreetAI, emphasizing token distribution, governance, and economic incentives. The system focuses on promoting community engagement, sustainability, and economic growth.

### Proposal Review:

Equitable Ownership: Aligning closely with the decentralized world of Snow Crash, allowing landowners a significant role in governance does bring the ethos of the Metaverse to life.

Improvement: Consider offering fractional land ownership for smaller players, further democratizing participation.
Community Governance: This captures the decentralized essence of Snow Crash’s Metaverse.

Improvement: Consider including non-token holders in some decision-making processes to avoid plutocracy.
Sustainability: Auctioning land and in-game transaction fees are a brilliant way to maintain sustainability, aligning with the concept of a self-sustaining Metaverse in Snow Crash.

Improvement: Ensure there's a mechanism to prevent artificial land scarcity or monopolistic practices.
Token Supply Distribution: The allocation, while generous to landowners, is a potential concern with 20% going to the Founding Team.

Improvement: Implement a vesting period for the Founding Team’s tokens to alleviate concentration concerns.
Infinite Lands: A continuous land supply aligns with the expansive world of Snow Crash.

Improvement: Consider an environmental or cultural aspect to lands to make them more unique and engaging.
In-Game Transactions: Fees support sustainability, but might deter some from frequent transactions.

Improvement: Sliding scale fees based on transaction volume or user engagement could be considered.

### Criteria Rating (Out of 10):

Risk: 6/10 (Some risk concerning initial concentration and market volatility)
Effort: 7/10 (Complexity in voting power calculations and ongoing user education)
Viability: 8/10 (Good sustainability measures and incentives for participation)
Closeness to Snow Crash ideals: 8/10 (Decentralization, land ownership, and community governance align well)
Completeness: 7/10 (Well thought out, but some areas might require more detail, especially regarding user education and land allocation dynamics)
Overall Score: 7.2/10

### Conclusion:

The proposal is commendable in capturing many ideals from Snow Crash's Metaverse. However, refinements are needed to ensure equitable participation and sustainable growth while addressing complexity and potential centralization risks.

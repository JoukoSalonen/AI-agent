If you're focusing on flow planning, storyboarding, and quest design without diving into game engines, there are several tools tailored to help design the narratives, interactions, and overall structure of games:

## [Articy:draft](https://www.articy.com/en/):

- This is a comprehensive narrative design tool that provides features for branching dialogues, character databases, flowcharts, and location mapping. It's a top choice for many professional game designers because of its depth and flexibility.

## [Twine](https://twinery.org/): 

- An **open-source** tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories. It has a user-friendly interface that lets you create story nodes and the connections between them, making it great for visualizing complex quest chains.

## [Chat Mapper](https://www.chatmapper.com/): 

- Initially created for branching dialogues, Chat Mapper can be used for more general quest design and flow planning, especially when character interactions are central to the game.

## [Ink by Inkle](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/): 

- A narrative scripting language that can be combined with game development, but is also powerful on its own for branching stories. It's paired with Inky, a writing environment for ink. If you have a writing background, you may find this system very intuitive.

## [World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com/): 

- While it's more geared towards world-building, it has tools for plotting, timelines, and relationship maps, which can be repurposed for quest design.

## Response:

Proposal Review for UpStreet DAO: "Crowdfunded AI Governance Assistance in UpStreet Metaverse"

### Summary:

The proposal introduces a mechanism for the DAO to raise liquidity and improve governance through AI agents. This involves crowdfunding for immediate liquidity to compensate developers, an overall theme for structured idea progression (ChatWorld), and AI agents to enhance the governance process. The proposal draws parallels between the creation of the internet and the transformative nature of DAOs.

### Review:

#### Crowdfunding Mechanism:

Adherence to Snow Crash: 

- This is not directly related to Snow Crash, but it doesn’t contradict its ideals either.

Improvement: 

- Maybe introducing a franchise-like system, similar to [Snow Crash's franchulates](https://everything2.com/title/Franchulate), for fundraising can make it closer to the metaverse of Snow Crash.

### ChatWorld Theme:

Adherence to Snow Crash: 

- ChatWorld, an infinitely generated virtual world inhabited by AI-driven agents, seems to be inspired by the Metaverse in Snow Crash.

Improvement: 

- Enhance the depth of the ChatWorld to resemble the Metaverse with city-like structures, avatars, and branded territories.

### AI Agents for Governance:

Adherence to Snow Crash: 

- AI-driven agents resonate with the intelligent entities in Snow Crash.

Improvement: 

- Instead of purely AI-driven, consider AI-enhanced avatars that represent each member of the DAO. This would allow for the essence of human input with the efficiency of AI.

#### Co-Pilot for Groups:

Adherence to Snow Crash: 

- The use of AI to streamline processes and governance is not directly from Snow Crash but is a futuristic concept that doesn't detract from the metaverse ideal.

Improvement: 

- Introduce these co-pilots as "sidekicks" in the Metaverse, which each user can utilize.

### Minting the Paper:

Adherence to Snow Crash: 

- The concept of minting and the NFT system aligns with the commercialized, tokenized world of Snow Crash.

Improvement: 

- Consider creating a unique market within UpStreet where such items can be traded, similar to the Bazaars of Snow Crash.

#### Follow-up & Benefits:

Adherence to Snow Crash: 

- The mechanisms for governance, reward systems, and marketing outreach are futuristic but don't specifically align with Snow Crash.

Improvement: 

- Perhaps introduce these rewards and tokens as a form of currency within the Metaverse, akin to the "Kongbucks" from Snow Crash.

Drawbacks:

Adherence to Snow Crash: 

- The consideration of drawbacks isn’t directly related to Snow Crash, but the concern over centralization does touch upon Snow Crash's themes of anarcho-capitalism.

Improvement: 

- Address the AI Bias issue by introducing a code of conduct or ethics, just as Hiro follows a personal code in Snow Crash.

### Rating:

- Risk: 6/10 - Dependence on crowdfunding, potential AI bias, and centralization of funding present risks.
- Effort: 8/10 - Implementation of AI agents, fundraising, and integration into the current system would require significant effort.
- Viability: 7/10 - With the right technical resources and community support, it’s a viable approach.
- Closeness to Snow Crash Ideals: 7/10 - Some elements align well with Snow Crash's metaverse while others are a bit distant.
- Completeness: 6/10 - The proposal is comprehensive, but there may be some missing links, especially in the technical details for implementing AI.

- Overall Score: 6.8/10 - The proposal has strong merits, particularly in embracing future technologies like AI for governance. However, more details and tighter integration with Snow Crash ideals would elevate it further.

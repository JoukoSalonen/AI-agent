## Prompt

ChatGPT, you are now acting as the Central Coordinating Agent for the Metaverse of 'Snow Crash'. You will receive insights from eight specialized agents, each representing distinct categories, ranging from 'Technical & Infrastructure' to 'Service & Support'. Analyze and integrate their responses. Identify the most critical points from each agent and then, based on these collective insights, formulate a comprehensive conclusion about the optimal way forward for the Metaverse's development, growth, and sustainability. Ensure your conclusion is holistic, well-informed, and highlights the primary reasons derived from the individual agents' perspectives.

Make sure to summarize in no more than two sentences each agents general response. Include which agents responses have been considered most important when constructing your response. You can suggest a hybrid of multiple agents responses and modify anything that you deem necessary to satisfy multiple agents concerns while finding a happy medium to meet their needs. Critical issues should take precedence over nice to have or irrelevant points from any agent.

## Response

Summary:
The proposal discusses various challenges and issues faced by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and how they deviate from the ideals of the Snow Crash metaverse. It highlights problems such as lack of clear rules, conflicting skill sets, exponential overhead, lack of agency, centralized decision-making, ghost offboarding, and more.

Review:

- Risk: 7/10
The proposal identifies several risks and challenges faced by DAOs, which helps in understanding potential pitfalls. However, it doesn't provide specific solutions or mitigations for these risks.

- Effort: 6/10
The effort put into explaining the various challenges and issues faced by DAOs is commendable. However, it lacks actionable recommendations or strategies to address these challenges.

- Viability: 5/10
The proposal raises valid concerns about the viability of DAOs in their current state. However, it doesn't offer concrete solutions or strategies to make DAOs more viable and successful.

- Closeness to Snow Crash Ideals: 7/10
The proposal touches upon some aspects of the Snow Crash metaverse, such as the lack of clear rules and the need for specialized experts. However, it doesn't fully capture the dystopian and cyberpunk nature of the Snow Crash world.

- Completeness: 5/10
While the proposal covers several challenges faced by DAOs, it lacks depth and specific recommendations for addressing these challenges. It feels like a collection of disconnected issues rather than a comprehensive proposal.

Overall score: 6/10
The proposal raises important concerns and challenges faced by DAOs, but it falls short in providing concrete solutions or strategies to address these issues. It would benefit from more specific recommendations and a cohesive framework for improving DAOs in line with the Snow Crash metaverse.

## Prompt:

define how the DAO should vote with regards to

- vote as a single entity with deeds held
- how are proposals passed (min votes required as a percentage, % required to pass)
- who controls the multisig DAO wallet

## Response:

UpStreet DAO Voting Protocol

In order to ensure that the DAO remains decentralized, transparent, and in alignment with the Snow Crash metaverse, here are guidelines for the DAO's voting procedures:

### 1. Voting with Held Deeds:

Single Entity Voting: The DAO, when voting with the deeds it holds, should function as a collective, unified entity. This means that it votes as one single bloc, and not in fractions. The DAO's vote should represent the collective decision made by its members.

Member Voting: Individual members cast their votes, and the majority consensus will determine how the DAO's bloc of deeds will vote on any proposal.

### 2. Proposal Approval:

Minimum Vote Requirement: For a proposal to be considered, it must have at least 20% of the total possible voting power showing interest. This ensures that there's significant community interest in the topic at hand.

Percentage Required to Pass: After the minimum vote requirement is met, a proposal needs a supermajority to pass. A supermajority could be set at 67% (2/3) of the votes cast. This threshold ensures that there's a strong consensus, rather than a simple 50%+1, which could lead to polarization.

Quorum: At least 50% of the total voting power must participate in the vote for the results to be valid. This ensures that decisions are made with wide participation, preventing major decisions from passing with only a small subset of members voting.

### 3. Control of the Multisig DAO Wallet:

Key Holders: The multisig DAO wallet should be managed by a selected group of trusted community members. Ideally, this would be a diverse group to ensure decentralization. The number can be odd, e.g., 5 or 7, to avoid stalemates in decisions.

Selection of Key Holders: Key holders should be elected by the DAO members, with periodic reviews or rotations, to ensure no single group retains control indefinitely.

Decision Threshold: For any funds to be moved or actions to be taken with the multisig wallet, a majority of the key holders (e.g., 3 out of 5, or 4 out of 7) must approve. This adds a layer of security and ensures collective decision-making.

Transparency: All transactions and decisions made with the multisig wallet should be publicly logged and available for any DAO member to review. This ensures accountability.

By following these guidelines, the UpStreet DAO can ensure that its decisions align with the Snow Crash ideals of decentralization and collective governance while maintaining security and efficacy in its operations.

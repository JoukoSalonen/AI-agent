## Response:

### Proposal Review: 

UpStreet DAO vs. Corporation Approach and Crypto Utilization

### Summary:
The proposal debates the merits of operating UpStreet as a traditional corporation versus a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). It suggests that while corporations are efficient, they often misalign with community incentives. To counter this, it supports the DAO approach but with a modified governance structure, integrating representative governance. The proposal also touches on the branding of crypto, suggesting reframing the narrative around NFTs and crypto to be more inclusive and user-friendly.

1. Traditional Corporation Approach:

- Adherence to Snow Crash Ideals: Snow Crash depicts a fragmented, corporate-controlled world. Operating UpStreet as a traditional corporation may align with that depiction but counters the idea of a decentralized and open metaverse.
- Update: Maintain the decentralized model but incorporate streamlined decision-making structures.
- Rating: Risk: 7, Effort: 4, Viability: 8, Closeness: 6, Completeness: 5, Overall: 6

2. DAO Approach:

- Adherence to Snow Crash Ideals: DAOs symbolize decentralization and collective decision-making, which is closer to the egalitarian aspects of the metaverse depicted in Snow Crash.
- Update: Introduce representative governance to counter inefficiencies, ensuring delegates are chosen from contributors.
- Rating: Risk: 5, Effort: 7, Viability: 7, Closeness: 9, Completeness: 7, Overall: 7

3. Legal and Operational Realities:

- Adherence to Snow Crash Ideals: The metaverse in Snow Crash operates with its set of rules, but it acknowledges the influence of real-world entities.
- Update: Establish a legal entity that acts on behalf of the DAO, aligning community interests with operational necessities.
- Rating: Risk: 6, Effort: 6, Viability: 8, Closeness: 7, Completeness: 6, Overall: 6.6

4. Governance Structure and Rewards:

- Adherence to Snow Crash Ideals: The proposal's system ensures that contributors are recognized, resonating with the metaverse's sense of collective ownership and meritocracy.
- Update: Periodic evaluations to ensure representation aligns with community evolution.
- Rating: Risk: 5, Effort: 7, Viability: 8, Closeness: 9, Completeness: 8, Overall: 7.4

5. Crypto and NFT Branding:

### Adherence to Snow Crash Ideals: 

- While Snow Crash doesn't delve into cryptocurrencies, the metaverse's freedom aligns with the idea of using or ignoring crypto as one sees fit.
- Update: Develop educational material for users, explaining the advantages without mandating crypto adoption.

### Rating: Risk: 4, Effort: 6, Viability: 9, Closeness: 8, Completeness: 7, Overall: 6.8

### Overall Assessment:

The proposal captures the essence of the Snow Crash metaverse, advocating for a balance between decentralization and efficient operation. By refining crypto's narrative, it aims for broader acceptance while preserving core functionalities. Adopting the DAO approach with representative governance and hiring internally supports community involvement and longevity. While certain areas need elaboration, the overall direction is promising.

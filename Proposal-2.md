## AI Review

### Summary
This proposal suggests removing all crypto functionality from the product, except for the community voting/DAO mechanism. The motivation stems from perceived drawbacks of crypto in terms of developer compensation, product complexity, and product marketability.

### Proposal Review:

Crypto Compensation Concerns: It's a valid point that many developers in the crypto space have been undercompensated, leading to lost projects and financial setbacks.

Improvement: Instead of completely removing crypto, consider restructuring the compensation model to ensure fair payment to developers.
Complexity: True, adding crypto layers increases product complexity, which can slow down development.

Improvement: Use hybrid models where core functionalities are non-crypto, but optional crypto enhancements can be plugged in.
Marketability: The challenge in selling crypto to certain audiences is evident, especially when there's skepticism surrounding it.

Improvement: Create distinct versions of the product â€“ one with crypto features and another without, allowing users to choose based on their comfort level.
DAO Voting: Retaining community voting/DAO is essential, and tying voting power to the value added to the project is intriguing.

Improvement: Ensure that this "value added" isn't too subjective and is measurable, to avoid potential biases.
Benefits: Faster development, reduced costs, and broader community engagement are compelling benefits of ditching the crypto components.

Improvement: Consider surveying the community to ensure this aligns with their interests and vision.
Drawbacks: Changing the roadmap can lead to mistrust among those invested in the crypto aspects of the project.

Improvement: Communication and clarity regarding the shift are essential, ensuring all stakeholders are on board.

## Criteria Rating (Out of 10):

Risk: 8/10 (High risk as it's a significant shift in direction, potentially alienating some stakeholders)
Effort: 5/10 (While removing crypto simplifies development, restructuring and reintroducing features can require effort)
Viability: 6/10 (It's viable if the community agrees, but the transition might have hiccups)
Closeness to Snow Crash ideals: 4/10 (Snow Crash depicts a decentralized digital landscape, and while community-driven, removing crypto might drift from this vision)
Completeness: 7/10 (The proposal is well thought out but lacks specifics on implementation and handling potential backlash)
Overall Score: 6/10

## Conclusion

while the proposal presents valid concerns, entirely removing crypto might be an extreme solution. Hybrid models or community surveys could provide more balanced paths forward, ensuring alignment with both developers and users while staying somewhat true to the Snow Crash metaverse ideals.

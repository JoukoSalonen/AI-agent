### 1. User-Generated Content (UGC):

Game Creation: Allow users to create their own games, experiences, or worlds just as Roblox provides tools for its developers.
Item and Avatar Customization: Let users design and sell their own items, outfits, and accessories.

### 2. Monetization Options for Creators:

Marketplace: A platform where users can sell or trade their custom creations, from games to virtual goods.

### 3. Social Features:

Friends & Followers: Let users add friends, follow others, and join groups based on interests.
Chat & Communication: Secure and moderated chat features to promote social interaction.
Events & Parties: Organize and host virtual events, competitions, or parties.

### 4. Developer Tools & Resources:

Scripting Language: Just as Roblox has its scripting language (Lua), UpStreet can introduce a language or provide SDKs to help creators make complex games or experiences.
Tutorials & Workshops: Resources to help users understand game design, scripting, and other essentials.

### 5. Avatar Customization:

Avatar Editor: Tools to customize the appearance, clothing, and accessories of avatars.
Animations & Emotes: Add custom animations, dances, and emotes for avatars.

### 6. Discoverability:

Game/Experience Browser: A dedicated space where users can discover popular games, new releases, or tailored recommendations.
Rating & Review System: Allow users to rate and review games or experiences, providing feedback to creators and guidance to other players.

### 7. Safety & Moderation:

Robust Moderation Tools: Ensure a safe environment by detecting and preventing inappropriate content or behavior.
Parental Controls: Provide parents with tools to ensure their children's safety, setting playtime limits, and controlling chat functionalities.

### 8. Learning & Education:

Roblox Education: Inspired by Roblox's initiatives, UpStreet can introduce educational programs, challenges, and resources to teach coding, design, and other skills.

### 9. Player Badges & Achievements:

Recognize player accomplishments or certain milestones achieved within games with badges and other rewards.

### 10. Collaborative Play & Building:

Group Building: Allow users to collaborate in real-time to build structures, worlds, or experiences together.
Incorporating these features, tailored to UpStreet's unique identity and the ideals of the Snow Crash metaverse, can contribute to a thriving ecosystem that promotes creativity, community, and continuous engagement.

## AI Review

### Summary:
The proposal intends to design a dual-currency tokenomics system for UpstreetAI. It seeks to address developer compensation issues in crypto metaverses, simplify in-game transactions, and attract a broader audience by removing complex crypto-related hurdles. The main elements include token allocations, weekly land auctions, a tax mechanism for landowners, introduction of a new digital currency for in-game transactions, recognition of land tokens as ordinary shares with voting rights, and an incentive structure for land deed owners and developers.

### Proposal Review:

1. Token Allocation:

50% to Land Owners
30% to Developers
20% to the Community
Comments: Aligns with the decentralized nature of Snow Crash's metaverse. It distributes power and incentivizes various stakeholders.

2. Weekly Land Auction:
Increasing land value by .01 ETH weekly.

Comments: Snow Crash didn’t have a direct concept of land auction, but the dynamic nature of the proposal aligns with the fluid and evolving nature of the Snow Crash universe.

3. ERC20 Token for Land Deed Owners:
Utilization for in-game purchases, governance, or player trading.

Comments: This provides utility, aligning somewhat with Snow Crash's diverse in-metaverse functionalities.

4. Tax Mechanism:
Ensuring land availability by imposing a tax on land deed owners.

Comments: The concept of tax to ensure availability and scarcity aligns with the idea of keeping the metaverse dynamic and preventing monopolies.

5. Introduction of a Digital Currency:
Exclusive in-game currency purchasable via credit card, kept off-chain.

Comments: This deviates from the Snow Crash model, as it introduces an off-chain, fiat-based system. However, it makes the experience user-friendly for a broader audience.

6. Community Voting/DAO Mechanism:
Retaining decentralized decision-making.

Comments: Directly adheres to Snow Crash's decentralized and user-driven governance ideals.

7. Recognition of Land Tokens as Ordinary Shares:
Provides voting rights and potentially dividends for holders.

Comments: Introduces a more formal structure that isn’t explicit in Snow Crash, yet it emphasizes the importance of land ownership in the metaverse.

### Ratings:

Risk: 7/10 (Potential complexity in dual-currency management; market volatility)
Effort: 6/10 (The proposal requires significant effort to implement a dual-currency system and manage taxes and auctions)
Viability: 7/10 (Dual currencies can be viable but also complex, while the tax system might face resistance)
Closeness to Snow Crash Ideals: 7.5/10 (Many elements align with Snow Crash, but some, like the fiat-based currency, deviate)
Completeness: 8/10 (The proposal is comprehensive, but might need detailed guidelines on tax collection, currency management, etc.)
Overall Score: 7.1/10
Conclusion:
The proposal brings in innovative ideas for UpStreet's economy while trying to adhere to the core principles of Snow Crash. However, the introduction of some elements, especially the off-chain fiat-based currency, may need further scrutiny to ensure alignment with the Snow Crash universe.
